	  <h4>The Agenda for Sustainable Development </h4>
    
    <p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. As the organisation <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs ">explains</a>, with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Agenda “provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planted, now and into the future.”</p>

    <p>One of the SDGs is <strong>“Gender equality”</strong>, and its purpose is to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.</p>

    <p>As the UN <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/genderequalityandwomensempowerment  ">points out</a>, gender inequalities are still deep-rooted in every society. “Women suffer from lack of access to decent work and face occupational segregation and gender wage gaps. In many situations, they are denied access to basic education and health care and are victims of violence and discrimination. They are under-represented in political and economic decision-making processes.”</p>

    <p>This is why one of the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg5 ">targets</a> of the Goal is to “ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life”.</p>

    <p>One indicator to measure this goal is the proportion of women in managerial positions. Thanks to the data collected and shared by the International Labour Organization (ILO), we can track how far we’ve come in this issue.</p>

    <p>The following work will be divided in three sections: </p>
    <ul> 
            <li>Women in managerial positions: a general picture of this indicator</li>
            <li>Gender equality in 2017: a picture using recent data</li>
            <li>Gender equality 2017-2019: a brief analysis of a time period</li>
          </ul>
