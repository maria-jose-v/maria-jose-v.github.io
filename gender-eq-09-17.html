                            <h4>Gender equality in labour</h4>
                            <p><em><strong>The world from 2009 to 2017</strong></em></p>
                            <br>
                        
                                <p>A 2017 report from the UN Secretary-General titled "Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals" confirmed that women are still underrepresented in managerial positions and it stablishes that “in the majority of the 67 countries with data from 2009 to 2015, fewer than a third of senior- and middle-management positions were held by women.”
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>Analysing ILO data from 2009 to 2017, we see that even though the world’s average percentage of this indicator has been steadily growing, it is still in the 30% range, supporting UN’s affirmation that just over a third of senior management positions are held by women around the world.
                                </p>
                        <br>

                                <br>
                                <p>In the following map, we see how America and Europe are slightly turning greener, which means some regions are increasing the percentage of women in senior positions. However, there’s little to none progress in the Middle East.
                                </p>
                                <br>

                        <br>
                                <p>Regarding the goal of achieving gender equality, the last UN <a href="hhttps://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2018/overview/">report</a> says that “while some forms of discrimination against women and girls are diminishing, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprives them of basic rights and opportunities.” 
                                </p>
                                <p>“Empowering women requires addressing structural issues such as unfair social norms and attitudes as well as developing progressive legal frameworks that promote equality between women and men.”
                                </p>
                                <p>With the data the International Labour Organization provides about this goal, I hope I have shown a general picture of gender equality in 2017, as well as a brief analysis of how little this has evolved over a period of time.
                                </p>
                                <p>I found particularly interesting the relationship between gender wage gap and women in managerial positions and I hope I showed how in countries where the wage gap is smaller, more women are in charge in senior positions.
                                </p>
